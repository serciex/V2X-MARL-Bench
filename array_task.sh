# 50 array tasks = 10 loc values x 5 parallel trials each (index / 5 -> loc,
# index % 5 -> trial number, used only for this script's own log filenames --
# main.py itself has no --trial_run flag, so all 5 parallel copies for a
# given loc write with the same internal trial_run=0; they're only
# distinguished by output timestamp). TAG (NFF or FF) is passed in by
# run_batch.sh via --export when it submits this with sbatch. Each task sets
# fast_fading_enabled in Configuration/env_params.py itself, right before
# running python3 (see below) -- not the submitting wrapper -- since this
# task might sit in the queue for a while before it actually runs, and
# main.py only reads that file once, near startup.

# a stale $SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR inherited from an unrelated ancestor process
# (e.g. a JupyterHub terminal whose own session was itself a different Slurm
